# Deprecation of this repository

As things evolve also our project "Piper" evolves and we changed the way how we implement pipelines and how we publish examples.

You can find the [Fiori UI5 pipeline here ][piper-pipelines-fiori].
Additional scenarios can also be found here https://sap.github.io/jenkins-library/ at the Scenarios menu.

Please open issues in future directly in https://github.com/SAP/jenkins-library/issues


After one month we will also clear the content here.
